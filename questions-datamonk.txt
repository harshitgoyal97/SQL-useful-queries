Q1. You have a table with the following 3 columns //Link --> http://thedatamonk.com/question/case-study-in-sql/

customer_id, order_id, order_date
123          987       2/9/2020
123          1234      4/9/2020
456          1211      1/1/2019
456          2344      8/8/2020

We want to know the number of customer who have their first two orders in the last 180 days. In the above example 123 will qualify but 456 won’t qualify

A1. SELECT count(customer_id) FROM
(SELECT customer_id, TotalRows FROM
(SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) As totalRows
FROM table
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING MIN(order_date) >= DATEADD(day, -180, GetDate())) As t1
WHERE TotalRows >= 2) As t2

Q2. Pivot a table in SQL without using pivot function //Link --> http://thedatamonk.com/question/pivot-a-table-in-sql-without-using-pivot-function/
Suppose there are two columns
Age Name
25   Nitin
30   Amit
27   Rishab
29   Ankush

Convert into
Name.  Nitin.  Amit. Rishab. Ankush
Age.   25.     30.   27.     29

A2. With CTE As
(SELECT Age, Name, ROW_NUMBER() OVER() As Row_Number
FROM table)
SELECT
MAX(CASE Name WHEN ‘Nitin’ Then Age End) Nitin,
MAX(CASE Name WHEN ‘Amit’ Then Age End) Amit,
MAX(CASE Name WHEN ‘Rishab’ Then Age End) Rishab,
MAX(CASE Name WHEN ‘Ankush’ Then Age End) Ankush
FROM CTE
GROUP BY Row_Number

Q3. Create a ranking row without using Rank function in SQL //Link --> http://thedatamonk.com/question/create-a-ranking-row-without-using-rank-function-in-sql/

You have to create one more column in predefined table with Name, Id,Department, and Salary.
Now you have to create new column with Rank in it partition by Department

A3. SELECT Name, Id, Department, Salary,
(SELECT COUNT(*) + 1 FROM Emp A
WHERE A.Department = B.Department AND A.Salary > B.Salary) As Rank
FROM Emp B
ORDER BY Department, Salary DESC
